### What is a Module?

Authors divide their books into chapters and sections.Similarly a developer should divide their programs into modules 

Good modules, are highly self-contained with distinct functionality, allowing them to be shuffled, removed, or added as necessary, without disrupting the system as a whole.

### Why we use Module?

* Maintainability
* Namespacing - variables outside the scope of a top-level function are global. Because of this, it’s common to have “namespace pollution”, where completely unrelated code shares global variables.
* Reusability
